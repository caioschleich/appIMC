# BMI Simple Calculator

## Introduction

BMI Simple Calculator is a multiplatform single page app developed in React Native. The main purpose for its development was to study and run the React Native structure and its components for the first time, as long as understanding how to translate HTML5 and CSS tags and structure to React Native default.

## Usage

This simple page application allows users to calculate their BMI by inserting height and weight in its respective input fields. Once every data is set, a user can hit the Calculate main button and check the output number calculated by the application shown in the bottom area of the interface.
